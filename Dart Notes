6) Operators and Operands  
  Type test Operators are a new kind introduced in Dart and which we generally don't see in the conventional programming languages
   - These operators are handy for checking types at runtime.
   - is, is! 
   - Ex: 
        void main() { 
         int n = 2; 
         print(n is int); 
       }
   
   - '??='  - Assigns the value only if the variable is null
   - sum = a??b   => if a = null, then chek if b is not null and assign it. If a not null, then sum = a
